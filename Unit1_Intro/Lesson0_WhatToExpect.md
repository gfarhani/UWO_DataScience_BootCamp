# Welcome to Data Science Without Tears!

<img align="right" src="../figs/shampoobottle.png" width=225px>

In the next 6 weeks, we'll cover:

- Where to find data and how to clean it
- Breadth of topics in DS (e.g., philosophy of data)
- Basic theoretical foundation of DS (linear models, cross validation)
- Basic Python code for examining and analyzing your data
- **Ethics**


# Each Week is One Unit

- 6 weeks/ units in the course
- 3-5 lessons (slides, short asynchronous videos) in a week/unit
- 3-5 active learning activities for you to try on your own in each unit
- 1 "Coffee Shop Office Hour" per unit to co-work or get more help 

# Each Week/ Unit Includes 3-5 Lessons

- < 10 minutes each
- Lessons will include short video guides and/or slides for you to review asynchronously
- Hands-on activities with ready-to-use data 
- Opportunities to complete deliverables to earn course certificate 

# What Do You Need to Do in Order to Earn the Certificate? 

- Put some time to go through the lessons! 
- Deliver the final project.

# What is the Final Project

- You will form small teams (maximum of 3 participants). Each team will be provided with a machine learning project (delivarable by the end of the BootCamp).  

# Your Instructor

- Ghazal Farhani (gfarhani@uwo.ca)

    
# Office Hours

- Course instructor will be available during synchronous office hours from 3-4 PM EST on Thursdays (access link via OWL) to discuss course materials and to help you to become a successful Data Scientist! 
    - We're NOT consultants (sorry)
        - See Western's Data Science Solutions for consultations.
- You are always welcome to post questions to our Data Science Without Tears discussion board on OWL. Your colleagues might have the same questions that you do!

# Accessing Materials

- **You DON'T need to install anything on your computer!**
- We will use a few websites in this course:
    
    1. GitHub
        - All course materials (including drafts) will also be housed on GitHub. You will need a free account. This gives participants a voluntary opportunity to familiarize themselves with a popular collaborative version management platform.
    2. Google Colab 
        - Colab is a Python development environment that runs in the browser using Google Cloud.
        - We'll use Google Colab to share Python code with you

# Who Made the Contents of this BootCamp

Ghazal Farhani, Devan Becker, and Alexis Lerner developed the contents of this bootcamp. Devan and Alex has left the program, however, they have provided some amazing videos related to the material of this BootCamp. 

# Let's Get Started!

We are glad you are here and look forward to learning together!
