## Lets talk about ethics!

Lets start with some examples:

1) I am working in a magazine and I would like to get as many subscribers as possible. I was told people in some regions of Canada are richer, and they might pay more for the subscription compared to other parts of contry. I started getting subscribers, and now I have access to all subscribers' postal codes. Is it ok to use the postal code to determine the price of a subscription?

2) I want to make a model that predicts the age of breast cancer in women (aka: the model will recommand mamography for each woman based on their age). In my training phase, most of my data comes from a specific race/ ethnicity. This bias will result in wrong (and dangerous) recommendations.


## Case Study: Predicting Recidivism

Consider the following YouTube video:

If you prefer reading, the video heavily references the following article: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

Some questions:

1. What exactly are the algorithms predicting?
2. If the algorithms aren't using race and are producing predictions similar to the observed data, how could they possibly be biased?
